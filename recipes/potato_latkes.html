    <!--2 paragraph description-->
    <p>"Before you put the potato mixture in the pan, take the scoop and
        make sure to drain the liquid out by holding the spoonful of potato
        against the side of the bowl," suggests recipe submitter and Allrecipes
        Allstar Lindsay. "Also we usually crush the saltines in a Baggie, it saves
        on mess."

    <ol>
        <li><p>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in
            a large bowl.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture
            against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil;
            slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so
            they are an even thickness.

        </p></li>
        <li><p>Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes
            per side. Drain latkes on a paper towel-line plate.
